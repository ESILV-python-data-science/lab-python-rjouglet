## Question 5 : K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN)

_Test the k-NN with k= 1 on both the training and the test set. Print the score produced by metrics.accuracy_score_

The best value for this parameter depends on the classification task and has to be found by trying different values and selecting the one with the best accuracy. for k= 1 / accruacy score : 0.924 for k= 2 / accruacy score : 0.921 for k= 3 / accruacy score : 0.931 for k= 4 / accruacy score : 0.927 for k= 5 / accruacy score : 0.934 for k= 6 / accruacy score : 0.932

## Question 6 : KNN best value for k

_Create three sets : train set (60%), validation set (20%) and test set (20%), using twice train_test_split Train a kNN classifier with different values of k and report the train/valid/test accuracy. Select the is best value for k according to the accuracy on the dev set. Report the best performance of the classifier on the test set for this value of k._
